# Search-Suggestions
A program to generate Search Suggestions based on a given Search History. Two implementations: as a dynamic list and as a dynamic search tree.
The search history is stored as a collection of Query objects. These are stored in a QueryDepot, which can be either a QueryDepotList or a QueryDepotList, depending on the user's choice.
